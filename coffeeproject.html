    <h1>TYPES OF COFFEE</h1>
    <div class="a3">
        <h2>ESPRESSO</h2>
        <img src="./coffee-drinks_espresso.webp" alt="">
        <P>

            The espresso, also known as a short black, is approximately 1 oz. of highly concentrated coffee. Although
            simple in appearance, it can be difficult to master.

        </P>
    </div>
    <div class="a4">
        <h2>MACHIATO</h2>
        <img src="./machiato.webp" alt="">
        <P>

            The word macchiato means mark or stain. This is in reference to the mark that steamed milk leaves on the
            surface of the espresso as it is dashed into the drink. Flavoring syrups are often added to the drink
            according to customer preference.
        </P>
    </div>
    <div class="a5">
        <h2>CAPPUCINO</h2>
        <img src="./CAPPUCINO.webp" alt="">
        <p>
            This creamy coffee drink is usually consumed at breakfast time in Italy and is loved in the United States as
            well. It is usually associated with indulgence and comfort because of its thick foam layer and additional
            flavorings that can be added to it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="a6">
        <h2>CAFE LATTE</h2>
        <img src="./latte.webp" alt="">
        <p>
            Cafe lattes are considered an introductory coffee drink since the acidity and bitterness of coffee are cut
            by the amount of milk in the beverage. Flavoring syrups are often added to the latte for those who enjoy
            sweeter drinks.
